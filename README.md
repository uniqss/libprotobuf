libprotobuf for [Unreal Engine 4][]
=====

Link the google's `protocol bufffers` library as the third party in [Unreal Engine 4][].

Usage
-----

1. Import or copy the folder 'libprotobuf' into `<your project>/Source/ThirdParty/libprotobuf`.
1. Add the libprotobuf as a module into `<your project>.Build.cs`
  * `PrivateDependencyModuleNames.AddRange(new string[] { "CoreUObject", "Engine", "libprotobuf" });`
1. Generate two code files (header & source, ex: Message.pb.h & Message.pb.cc) of the protocal by `protoc` for `cpp`. (Ref: [Google's Protocol Buffers][])
1. Put them into the source directory (`Private` or `Public`) of your project.
1. Add these line in message cpp file(Mesage.pb.cc)
  ```C++
  #ifdef _MSC_VER
  #pragma warning(disable:4125)
  #endif
  ```    
4. Regenerate the code file for [Unreal Engine 4][] by `regenerateforue4.py`.
    * `python regenerateforue4.py 'the header file'`
    * ex: `python regenerateforue4.py Message.pb.h`
    * You should get this information: `Success to regenerate the code for UE4`
5. Include and use the header file(ex: Message.pb.h) in your `.cpp` file.
6. That's all.

Build Library
-----
1. Windows: Run `build_win64.py` (Visual Studio 2017 and [CMake][] is required)
1. Linux: Run `build_linux.py` ([clang][] and Unrea Engine Source Code is required)
